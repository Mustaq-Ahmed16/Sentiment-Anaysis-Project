# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) in tweets using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** models. Sentiment analysis on Twitter can help in understanding public opinion, customer feedback, political analysis, crisis management, and marketing research.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare tweets for analysis (removal of URLs, mentions, hashtags, punctuation, etc.).
- **Feature Extraction**: Convert preprocessed tweets into numerical features using techniques like **TF-IDF**.
- **Modeling**: Train and evaluate various machine learning models, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Bernoulli Naive Bayes
- **Evaluation**: Use accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve to measure performance.
- **Visualization**: Generate word clouds and visualize the distribution of sentiments.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `scripts/`: Includes the code for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks to explore the data and models.
- `results/`: Contains model evaluation results and visualizations.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib wordcloud scikit-learn nltk
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-twitter.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-twitter
   ```

2. Preprocess the data:

   ```bash
   python scripts/preprocess_data.py
   ```

3. Train the models:

   ```bash
   python scripts/train_model.py
   ```

4. Evaluate the models and visualize results:

   ```bash
   python scripts/evaluate_model.py
   ```

## Results

- **Accuracy**: 85%
- **F1-Score**: 0.82
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.87

## Visualizations

Here are some visual representations of the data and model performance:

## Future Enhancements

- Improve the model by using deep learning techniques like **LSTM** or **Transformer**.
- Implement a real-time sentiment analysis dashboard.
- Explore multilingual sentiment analysis.
